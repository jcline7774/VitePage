# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.  It was made as an example of a dynamic homepage created using javascript while giving us an intimate look into ReactJS coding, contemporary CSS, motion and more...

To view the working file, navigate to the "Actions" tab.  There you will see the "Pages-build-deployment" section that you can select.  On the box that says deploy, there is a blue hyperlink the will lead you to the react site as viewed through a browser.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh
