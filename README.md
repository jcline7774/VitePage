# React + Vite

Vite is a modern build tool designed for speed and efficiency, particularly when working with JavaScript frameworks like React. Developed by Evan You, the creator of Vue.js, Vite stands out due to its ability to deliver a fast and streamlined development experience.

Why I Chose Vite React?

Vite is a modern alternative to traditional code bundlers. It offers many benefits for anyone interested in React projects such as:

~ Instant Server Start 
      The Vite development server performs in near-instant startup due to its ability to skip bundling during development.

~ Fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR)
      Experience real-time updates to your React components drastcally reducing lag in iteration.

~ Optimized Production Builds 
      Vite can create efficient production bundles through its use of Rollup.  This takes advantage of features like code splitting.

~ Support for Modern Tools
